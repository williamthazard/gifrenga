# gifrenga
a renga made of GIFs
<br><br>
You can contribute to the renga by adding GIFS in the manner demonstrated in the existing code of the index.html file. Just add your contribution to the end. In keeping with the renga tradition, lines should alternate between 3 GIFs and 2 GIFs. Each lines is separated by 24 `<br>` tags (you can copy these from a previous entry). Each line is contained within a `<table>` tag. Each `<table>` has a single `row`, designated by a `<tr>` tag. Each GIF in the line is contained within a `<td>` tag. You can add a GIF inside of the `<td>` by adding an `<img>` tag wherein the `src` is the URL that directs to your GIF, the `alt` text is what will appear if your GIF fails to load, and the `title` text is what will appear if a visitor to the site hovers their cursor over your GIF. 
<br>
If all of this seems complicated, you can always just copy an existing entry, change the URL to direct to the GIF you'd like to add, and change the `alt` and `title` text to whatever you'd like it to be for your GIF.
