# gifrenga
a renga made of GIFs
<br><br><br>
You can contribute to the renga by adding GIFS in the manner demonstrated in the existing code of the `index.html` file. Just add your contribution to the end, after the last set of `<br>` tags and before the `</div>` at the end of the file. In keeping with the renga tradition, lines should alternate between 3 GIFs and 2 GIFs. Each line is separated by 24 `<br>` tags (you can copy these from a previous entry). Each line is contained within a `<table>` tag. Each `<table>` has a single `row`, designated by a `<tr>` tag. Each GIF in the line is contained within a `<td>` tag. You can add a GIF inside of the `<td>` by adding an `<img>` tag wherein the `src` is the URL that directs to your GIF, the `alt` text is what will appear if your GIF fails to load, and the `title` text is what will appear if a visitor to the site hovers their cursor over your GIF. All GIFs contributed to this project should have `alt` and `title` text.
<br><br>
If all of this seems too complicated, you can always just copy an existing entry, change the URLs to direct to the GIFs you'd like to add, and change the `alt` and `title` text to whatever you'd like for your GIFs.
